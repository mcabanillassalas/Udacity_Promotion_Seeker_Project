Brief reflection
I am a full-stack software developer with over eight years of experience in the design, development, and implementation of custom business solutions. Throughout my career, I have worked on complex projects that have required a comprehensive business vision, strategic thinking, and a results-oriented approach.

I specialize in creating robust, scalable platforms aligned with each organization's objectives. Beyond the technical aspects, I enjoy leading initiatives that optimize processes, reduce operational times, and generate tangible value for users and internal customers.

I have had the opportunity to coordinate technical teams at different stages of software development, promoting best practices, fostering collaborative work, and prioritizing continuous improvement. I value clear communication, data-driven decision-making, and creating environments where people can grow professionally.

Currently, my focus is on strengthening my leadership and management skills. I am at a professional stage where I seek to assume greater strategic responsibilities, contribute to the business vision, and guide teams toward common goals.

I firmly believe in technology as a tool to transform organizations, and in leadership as a way to inspire, organize, and build sustainable solutions over time.

The main changes I've made are improving the "About Me" section, creating an English version of my profile, and adding some skills.
